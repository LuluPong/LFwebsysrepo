Hosted site: https://cre8orss.github.io/constitution-page/index.html

Our annotated Constitution website functions off of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript/jQuery.
We researched a few websites where they had annotated constitutions to get an idea for
how we should structure our website. The main components of our website is our navigation
bar which allows users to skip to any part of the Constitution they want. As far as our
annotations go, we catered to college-age students where we have brief descriptions about
what each part of the Constitution means while also keeping detail. We also added a
section at the bottom of the page where you can see photos of the writers of the Constitution
and their names annotated. To access the annotations, the user just has to hover their 
mouse over the text and a summary of what that section is about pops up. This was implemented
using the Tooltip widget in the jQuery library. We also included some Google fonts to make 
the text easier to read.

I added Google fonts and images to the webpage. Since the main html was already
done by one group member, there was not much to add. There still seems to be communication issues.
Even though I made a branch that added Google Fonts to the majority of the webpage, another member 
also added fonts to the webpage. I decided not to merge my branch so there would not be a CSS conflict.
