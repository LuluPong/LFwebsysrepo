My optimizations consisted of: creating external CSS and JS files(Separation of concerns), minifying both CSS and JS files(Reducing amount of unnecessary bytes in files), creating JS variables for several repeating JS functions(Prevent having to read through the entire webpage several times), removing unnecessary empty tags(anchor tag at the beginning missing href and using improper attribute), compressing all images used in the site(reduces the time needed to load each image on the page), defering JS(Let's the page load without having to run JS while it loads), and replacing improper tags that required the creation of new ids(Tags like p tag at the end of the body could be replaced with a footer tag and doesnt require the use of an additional id).

For creativity, I used Google Fonts to provide a more-fitting font type. I also added a fade in animation for the page body in the CSS file. 

Issues:
***I wanted to use sprite sheet but I had difficulty implementing it. Since the CSS rules were all over the place, I had a hard time selectign which CSS redundant rules to remove and where to apply others. With the JS variables, I felt I was creating too many variables. In terms of creativity, I wanted to include a page background of a bee on a honeycomb(hence the bee photo in the assets folder). Unfortunately, I could not get the background to show. I also could not see where the colors stated in the original CSS files were being applied. I wanted to extend the max breakpoint for the page but ran out of time...***
