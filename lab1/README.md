LAB 1
____________________

My team and I created our group home page and our individual pages.
_____________________

Group Page:
Our group page was simple to make.
We kept our designs simple due to time constraints.
Communication was slow at first but we are doing much better now.


Individual Page:

My individual page consists of a resume and a picture of me.
I started by creating a basic HTML document with all the information I needed to include based on the Lab 1 instructions.
I revised my document to include hCard microformats after I read a little more about them
The microformatting was a bit confusing since I did not originally understand its purpose but after seeing the connections between 
microformats and XHTML, I was able to understand why I was including them in my HTML doc.

I got a bit carried away and started adding CSS before my group decided on a design style.
Unfortunately, I completed the whole page using a CSS framework before realizing my mistake. Thankfully, one of my groupmates reminded me of the instructions and
I was able to strip most off the framework from my code. I an unnecessary amount of div and span tags in my project but
because of time constraints I could not remove them all.

***NEW UPDATE***
I ended up using the Bulma framework again after seeing how well-designed many of the groups' webpages were.
*While Bulma is a nice and minimalistic framework to implement, I think Bootstrap offers more room for creativity

Our group moved all our files out of our original group repo and into a new organization repo


Validating my HTML was not too much of an issue except I forgot to add <ul*> tags before I started using <*li> tags.
