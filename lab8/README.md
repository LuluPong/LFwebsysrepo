Lab 8

***Last Lab of Semester***

**Part 1:**
----------------
Creating the JSON file was simple and easy with the help of on online guide. 
I was a bit confused as to what to put in the "title" section of each lab considering they 
were all "Lab" + "number".

**Parts 2 and 3:**
----------------
I had trouble reading the JSON file into my JS file.

I know I am going to get in trouble for hardcoding the navigation but I couldnt get my JS to parse my JSON file. I spent over two days trying to figure out what the issue was. I was able to parse json written within the script tags but any files I tried to parse would return nothing. I could not even get output to show in the console on VSCode and the console available in Developer Tools. For part 3, while I was able to create a simple login page, I had trouble validating the username and password. Every input would be validated as the correct password even when that was not the case. I don't know if hashing the passwords caused this issue or using bindParam() did. I have included the login page but it is not complete at all.
