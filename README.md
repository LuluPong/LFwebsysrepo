For Part 3, I used my Lab 7 work as a template. I made minor changes like removing extra buttons and pages to add content to specific tables.
At first I thought I made a mistake making my tables because I could not insert some of the original values on the google doc. I realized that these were some of the 'problems' we had to identify and fix. I made the correct changes and was able to produce accurate tables.
