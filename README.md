Quiz 1

_____________________________________________________________

Part 1:
I was able to do part one fairly quickly. I used a combination of my notes and online sources.

Part 2:
I have never coded in javascript before. This part was basically impossible for me to do
I tried using this source(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IV23QBgC41U) to help me but I could not get my live server up and running to test my code.
I was not able to apply any CSS since I could not see my code with live server.
