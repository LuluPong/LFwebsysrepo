Lab 3

Individual Lab

**This was a strictly individual lab**

This lab has been the most time-consuming by far. I started out by making the contact page since I thought it would take the least amount of time to make.
I decided to use a HTML-based form with no JS elements. Since the form did not need to be linked to any specific email address, I did not include 'mailto' addresses
in my contactpage.html
The faculty page was the most difficult page to make. Using cards inside of flexbox columns was much harder than I anticipated. The margins on the main container were
not properly aligned. I had to manually change the padding to make it appear centered. The next biggest challenge was the gargantuan amount of text that each faculty member except professor Callahan had for their 'bios'. I had to trim one faculty member's bio down because it was taking more 50% of the page's extra height. Unfortunately, all of these changes still did not allow me to design the page like I envisioned it. I wished for the cards to be a bit smaller and have a nice transparent effect. I wanted the text
to have better readability on desktop and mobile. The mobile dimensions and the padding made the page look a bit awkward.
The index page was a bit easier to make. I wanted to make the home page 'pop' with excitement; however, when I played around with some different page styles, I really liked the simplicity that the full page hero banner provided. I was a bit conflicted on whether I should've added more design to the content on the index page. When I thought about the purpose of the page I decided against it. Since the home page will be accessed by many people, it needs to be simple enough to be handled by most browsers and have good readability so that people can get the information they desire.
The news page was just a combination of tiles inside of tiles inside of tiles.
I decided to use an announcement for one news item, three news article, and a TikTok embed for the fifth news item. The code from the tiles came straight from the Bulma.io example. When I tried to implement it myself, the tiles did not align properly.


CSS
________

I decided to use the Bulma CSS framework. I contemplated using Bootstrap; however, Bulma's simplicity seemed like a better choice for the timescale of this project.
Bulma's features made it easy to incorporate CSS designs like cards, boxes, and more that would take a while to incorporate using vanilla CSS. I did struggle with designing some of the pages. While I wanted all the pages to look nice and uniform, I got carried away with some of the pages and used different designs for each page.

***I decided against using JS since I do not have much experience with it. I do believe if the deadline was a little later, I would have incorporated some JS into the page
to give it a little more pop.***

***Update***

After Friday's class I decided to try hover.css. Unfortunately, hover.css created a lot of conflicts with the bulma framework. Hover.css would change the padding ad margins on most of the items on my page. Some animations would not even run. 

Apology:
***I MADE THE MISTAKE OF NOT CREATING A PROPER FILE SUBSYSTEM. I TRIED TO MAKE ALL THE NECESSARY CHANGES BUT IT BROKE MY CODE. so i changed it back.***
