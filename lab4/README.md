Lab 4


GROUP PROJECT
____________________________

For this project, we used html, css, ajax, js, and json to create a website for GNH. 
There was some confusion as to who would do what and how to implement the AJAX and JSON.
This lab would be better if we actually assigned projects to each group member but it seems there is still some confusion over how 
to use projects.

Individual
__________
I created the contact page for the website. I used HTML and CSS. Since the website uses bootstrap, I used bootstrap to quickly make a simple form. I added
a favicon to the contact page using the GNH logo. For CSS, I used a simple background and imported Fonts from Google. Since I work on a widescreen monitor, most images I tried to use as a background would appear oddly stretched even though they looked fine on a 14" laptop screen. I decided to use a high res image to prevent any akward stretchiness in the background. I liked the simple 'boxin' animation I created for my last lab so I incorporated it in this contact page too.
